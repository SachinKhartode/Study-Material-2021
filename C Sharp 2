1. Delegate vs Event
An Event declaration adds a layer of abstraction and protection on the delegate instance. 
This protection prevents clients of the delegate from resetting the delegate and 
its invocation list and only allows adding or removing targets from the invocation list.

Explanation:
Delegates support ‘=’ assignment operator, events do not.
If you write your system with just delegate, the consumer may use ‘=’ operator to attach method without error. 
Now what issue this would introduce? As we said, the event can be subscribed by many components, so if we want to use delegates we must use ‘+=’ to support many methods. 
Suppose, someone forgets to use ‘+=’ and uses ‘=’, he will unknowingly detach all attached methods and attach only his method. 
This will be a big mess as other components will never receive event notification.
