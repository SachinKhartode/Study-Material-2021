A. Creational Design Pattern
Factory Method
In Factory pattern, we create the object without exposing the creation logic. 
In Factory method pattern, an interface is used for creating an object but lets the subclass decide which class to instantiate. 
The creation of an object is done when it is required. The Factory method allows a class later instantiation to subclasses.
