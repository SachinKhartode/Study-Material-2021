1. When to use Cosmos db or Sql db or Blob storage
A. Data can be in different forms like 
   1. Unstructured: Video, Audio, text
   2. Structured: excel, csv
   3. Semi Structured: json, xml, yaml
      eg. Product1 and Product2 can have different property
so, Cosmos db will be used for Semi structured data. 
Sql db will be used for Structured data. 
Blob storage will be used for unstructured data.
